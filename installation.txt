The script requires the CSV data described here:

https://github.com/jjsch/ami-adjacency-pair

The polarity model implementation assumes that the CSV data is in the directory ./csv

The polarity model requires the NLTK (http://www.nltk.org/) and scikit learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

NLTK requires the Punkt Tokenizer, Stopword Corpus and Averaged Perceptron Tagger. These can be downloaded with the NLTK download tool:

$python
>>>import nltk
>>>nltk.download()
